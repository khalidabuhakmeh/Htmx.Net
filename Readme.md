# Htmx.Net

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/master/www/img/htmx_logo.1.png)

This is a package designed to add server side helper methods for `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse`. This makes working with [htmx](https://htmx.org/) server-side concepts simpler.

## Htmx Extension Methods

### Getting Started

Install the `Htmx` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Htmx/) to your ASP.NET Core project.

```console
dotnet add package Htmx
```

### HttpRequest

Using the `HttpRequest`, we can determine if the request was initiated by Htmx on the client.

```c#
httpContext.Request.IsHtmx()
```

This can be used to either return a full page response or a partial page render.

```c#
// in a Razor Page
return Request.IsHtmx()
    ? Partial("_Form", this)
    : Page();
```

We can also retrieve the other header values htmx might set.

```c#
Request.IsHtmx(out var values);
```

Read more about the other header values on the [official documentation page](https://htmx.org/reference/#request_headers).

### HttpResponse

We can set Http Response headers using the `Htmx` extension method, which passes an action and `HtmxResponseHeaders` object.

```c#
Response.Htmx(h => {
    h.Push("/new-url")
     .TriggerAfterSettle("yes")
     .TriggerAfterSwap("cool");
});
```

Read more about the HTTP response headers at the [official documentation site](https://htmx.org/reference/#request_headers).

## Htmx.TagHelpers

### Getting Started

Install the `Htmx.TagHelpers` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Htmx.TagHelpers/) to your ASP.NET Core project. Targets .NET Core 3.1+ projects.

```console
dotnet add package Htmx.TagHelpers
```

You'll generally need URL paths pointing back to your ASP.NET Core backend. Luckily, `Htmx.TagHelpers` mimics the url generation included in ASP.NET Core. This makes linking HTMX with your ASP.NET Core application a seamless experience.

```html
<div hx-target="this">
    <button hx-get
            hx-page="Index"
            hx-page-handler="Snippet"
            hx-swap="outerHtml">
        Click Me (Razor Page w/ Handler)
    </button>
</div>

<div hx-target="this">
    <button hx-get
            hx-controller="Home"
            hx-action="Index"
            hx-route-id="1">
        Click Me (Controller)
    </button>
</div>

<div hx-target="this">
    <button hx-post
            hx-route="named">
        Click Me (Named)
    </button>
</div>
```

### Htmx.Config

An additional tag helper is included that makes creating htmx configuration simpler. For example, below we can set the `historyCacheSize`, default `indicatorClass`, and whether to include ASP.NET Core's anti-forgery tokens as an additional element on the HTMX configuration.

```html
    <meta name="htmx-config" 
          historyCacheSize="20"
          indicatorClass="htmx-indicator"
          includeAspNetAntiforgeryToken="true"
          />
```

The resulting HTML will be.

```html
<meta name="htmx-config" content='{"indicatorClass":"htmx-indicator","historyCacheSize":20,"antiForgery":{"formFieldName":"__RequestVerificationToken","headerName":"RequestVerificationToken","requestToken":"<token>"}}' />
```

### HTMX and Anti-forgery Tokens

You can set the attribute `includeAspNetAntiforgerToken` on the `htmx-config` element. Then you'll need to include this additional JavaScript in your web application.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("htmx:configRequest", (evt) => {
    let httpVerb = evt.detail.verb.toUpperCase();
    if (httpVerb === 'GET') return;

    let antiForgery = htmx.config.antiForgery;

    if (antiForgery) {

        // already specified on form, short circuit
        if (evt.detail.parameters[antiForgery.formFieldName])
            return;

        if (antiForgery.headerName) {
            evt.detail.headers[antiForgery.headerName]
                = antiForgery.requestToken;
        } else {
            evt.detail.parameters[antiForgery.formFieldName]
                = antiForgery.requestToken;
        }
    }
});
```

You can access the snippet in two ways. The first is to use the `HtmxSnippet` static class in your views.

```
<script>
@Html.Raw(HtmxSnippets.AntiforgeryJavaScript)
</script>
```

A simpler way is to use the `HtmlExtensions` class that extends `IHtmlHelper`.

```
@Html.HtmxAntiforgeryScript()
```

This html helper will result in a `<script>` tag along with the previously mentioned JavaScript. **Note: You can still register multiple event handlers for `htmx:configRequest`, so having more than one is ok.**
